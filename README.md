# Date Counter

This is a simple page that stores a date as a browser cookie and reports how many days until that date

The intent is to set the date for a child, and they can bookmark the page and check in every now and then to see how long it takes.

The use of typescript to write this up is probably overkill.  However I wanted to keep this page as simple as possible
